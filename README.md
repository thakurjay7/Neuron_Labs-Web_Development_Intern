I'm thrilled to announce the completion of two impressive projects during my journey as a web developer! üéâ These projects showcase my skills and dedication to creating useful and entertaining websites.

Netflix Clone Page üçø
In my quest to hone my web development abilities, I embarked on the journey of recreating the renowned Netflix Landing Page with painstaking attention to detail.

Online Code Editor üñ•Ô∏è
The second project I'm thrilled to unveil is an advanced online code editor designed for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This fully responsive editor empowers users to write, test, and experiment with code seamlessly. Its user-friendly interface and robust features make it a valuable resource for developers and coding enthusiasts alike.

I extend my profound gratitude to Coder's Cave for affording me this invaluable opportunity within their prestigious internship program.
